    "\n",
    "## **Versión 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configuración del Modelo:**\n",
    "  - Sin eliminación de *stopwords*.\n",
    "  - Sin lematización.\n",
    "  - Parámetros del `TfidfVectorizer`:\n",
    "    - `min_df=1`\n",
    "    - `max_df=1.0`\n",
    "    - `ngram_range=(1,1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resultados:**\n",
    "  - Dos consultas encontraron el documento relevante en la posición 1.\n",
    "  - Una consulta lo encontró en la posición 2.\n",
    "  - **MRR de 0.8333**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Análisis:**\n",
    "  - La ausencia de preprocesamiento avanzado limita la capacidad del modelo para capturar sinónimos y formas variantes de palabras.\n",
    "  - Al no eliminar *stopwords*, el modelo puede verse afectado por ruido de palabras comunes que no aportan significado significativo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Versión 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cambios Introducidos:**\n",
    "  - **Se implementó la lematización.**\n",
    "  - Se mantuvo sin eliminar *stopwords*.\n",
    "  - Mismos parámetros del `TfidfVectorizer` que en V1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resultados:**\n",
    "  - Dos consultas encontraron el documento relevante en la posición 1.\n",
    "  - Una consulta en la posición 2 (diferente a la de V1).\n",
    "  - **MRR de 0.8333** (igual que en V1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Análisis:**\n",
    "  - La lematización ayudó al modelo a reconocer diferentes formas de la misma palabra (por ejemplo, \"running\" y \"run\"), mejorando la comprensión semántica.\n",
    "  - Sin embargo, al no eliminar *stopwords*, el modelo aún puede estar influenciado por palabras comunes sin significado significativo.\n",
    "  - La mejora en una consulta se compensó con una ligera disminución en otra, manteniendo el MRR igual.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Versión 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cambios Introducidos:**\n",
    "  - **Se implementó la eliminación de *stopwords*.**\n",
    "  - **Se mantuvo la lematización.**\n",
    "  - **Ajustes en los parámetros del `TfidfVectorizer`:**\n",
    "    - `min_df=5` (elimina términos que aparecen en menos de 5 documentos)\n",
    "    - `max_df=0.8` (elimina términos que aparecen en más del 80% de los documentos)\n",
    "    - `ngram_range=(1,2)` (considera unigramas y bigramas)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resultados:**\n",
    "  - Todas las consultas encontraron el documento relevante en la posición 1.\n",
    "  - **MRR mejoró a 1.0000**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Análisis:**\n",
    "  - La eliminación de *stopwords* redujo el ruido en los datos, permitiendo que el modelo se enfoque en palabras más significativas.\n",
    "  - La lematización continuó mejorando la capacidad del modelo para entender variantes de palabras.\n",
    "  - El ajuste de los parámetros del `TfidfVectorizer`:\n",
    "    - **`min_df=5`** ayudó a eliminar términos poco frecuentes que no aportan valor.\n",
    "    - **`max_df=0.8`** eliminó términos demasiado comunes que podrían no ser útiles para distinguir documentos.\n",
    "    - **`ngram_range=(1,2)`** permitió capturar frases de dos palabras, mejorando la comprensión de contextos específicos.\n",
    "  - Estas mejoras condujeron a que los documentos relevantes fueran clasificados en la primera posición para todas las consultas, elevando el MRR al valor máximo posible de 1.0000.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Conclusiones y Recomendaciones**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importancia del Preprocesamiento:**\n",
    "  - La **eliminación de *stopwords*** y la **lematización** son técnicas de preprocesamiento esenciales que mejoran significativamente el rendimiento del modelo al reducir el ruido y normalizar las palabras.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Ajuste de Parámetros del Modelo:**\n",
    "  - Modificar parámetros como **`min_df`**, **`max_df`** y **`ngram_range`** en el `TfidfVectorizer` puede tener un impacto considerable en la calidad de los resultados.\n",
    "    - **`min_df`** ayuda a eliminar palabras demasiado raras que pueden no ser útiles.\n",
    "    - **`max_df`** filtra palabras demasiado comunes que no ayudan a distinguir entre documentos.\n",
    "    - **`ngram_range`** permite capturar contexto adicional mediante la consideración de secuencias de palabras (por ejemplo, bigramas).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mejora Continua:**\n",
    "  - Los resultados demuestran que **iterar y ajustar** tanto el preprocesamiento como los parámetros del modelo conduce a mejoras en el rendimiento.\n",
    "  - Es recomendable continuar experimentando con diferentes configuraciones y técnicas avanzadas (como modelos semánticos) para seguir optimizando el modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementación de Técnicas Avanzadas (Futuro Trabajo):**\n",
    "  - Considerar la incorporación de modelos de lenguaje pre-entrenados como **BERT** o **Word Embeddings** para capturar relaciones semánticas más profundas.\n",
    "  - Implementar métodos de **reducción de dimensionalidad** o **selección de características** para mejorar aún más el rendimiento.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nota:** La mejora del MRR de 0.8333 a 1.0000 en la **Versión 3** indica que el modelo, con las configuraciones y preprocesamiento aplicados, es capaz de recuperar consistentemente el documento relevante en la primera posición para todas las consultas evaluadas, lo cual es un resultado óptimo en términos de ranking y relevancia.\n"
